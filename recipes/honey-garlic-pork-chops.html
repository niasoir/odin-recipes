        </ul>

        <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pound the pork chops with a tenderizer or the back of a heavy knife until 1/4” (1/2 cm) thick. Cut the pounded pork into bite-sized pieces and transfer to a medium-sized bowl.</li>
            <li>Add all the marinade ingredients except the cornstarch and flour into the bowl with pork chops. Massage in the marinade with your hand. Marinate for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and stir to mix well.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a heavy bottomed skillet until about 350°F (176°C).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add the cornstarch and flour to the bowl with marinated pork chop. Mix until the pork is evenly coated. Add the chops to the preheated oil. Fry until both sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Remove the cooked pork onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat. Drain most of the oil from the skillet using a ladle, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the pan.</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat to medium. Add the garlic. Fry until fragrant and golden, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the sauce. Cook and stir until it reduces to a thin, syrupy consistency.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pork back to the reduced sauce. Stir a few times until it is well coated. Transfer everything to a serving plate. Garnish with sliced green onions and more fried garlic chips, if using.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately as a main dish.</li>
        </ol>
