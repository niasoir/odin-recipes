                <li>1 cup low-sodium beef broth</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)</li>

            </ul>

            <li>Stir-fry</li>
            <ul type = square>
                <li>4 tablespoons peanut oil , divided</li>
                <li>4 heads baby bok choy , quartered</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic , minced</li>
                <li>1 inch (2.5 cm) ginger , minced</li>
                <li>1/2 yellow onion , sliced</li>
                <li>1/2 carrot , sliced into strips</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the beef and the marinade ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Toss with your hands to coat the beef evenly and let marinate while preparing other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine the sauce ingredients in a medium-sized bowl and stir to mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Prepare the noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside in a colander to dry.</li>
            <li>Heat a large heavy-bottomed pan (nonstick or carbon steel) with 2 tablespoons of peanut oil over medium-high heat until hot. Spread the noodles into a patty shape. Cook without flipping until the bottoms turn golden. Turn the noodles to fry the other side until golden. Drizzle in a bit more oil to help with the frying, if needed. Once done, transfer the noodles to a big serving plate.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 tablespoon of oil into the same pan. Add the beef and spread it out in a single layer using a pair of tongs or chopsticks. Let cook undisturbed for 30 seconds or so, or until the bottom turns golden brown. Flip to cook the other side until browned. Stir a few times until the beef is cooked (it’s OK if there’s a hint of pink inside), transfer to a big plate, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add the onion and carrots. Quickly stir a few times to mix well. Add the ginger and garlic. Stir and cook for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Add the bok choy. Cook and stir for another minute, until the veggies start to soften.</li>
            <li>Stir the sauce thoroughly to dissolve the cornstarch completely and pour the sauce into the pan. Stir and cook to bring the sauce to a boil, and cook until it starts to thicken.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked beef back into the pan. Stir to mix everything well. Once the sauce reaches the desired consistency, pour everything over the fried noodles.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately as a main dish.</li>

        </ol>
